# Modules

Modules are additonial systems which can be added to the CORE in order to improve interactivity and boost realism.

These Modules come in the form of folders which can be dragged and dropped into the CORE Modules folder and will start working immideiatly.

Configuration for each module will be displayed in the CORE configuration which means configuration game-wide is stored in one place.
